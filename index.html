Css and html are languages but not programming, styling or mark-up language is a better way to put it

html - is a markup

h i for hyper

in html there is a heading

line between brackets is an element with text

html is a box within a box

start looking at website like boxes inside of boxes

when something is nested inside it's usually indented even though that is not a syntax requirement


<table> big box
	<tr> smaller box
		<td> just read it


<br> all that html does is give information about what is nested inside of what and gives the information


therapy website with a chatbox and linked articles that send to problems

a graphic trading interface for people that know shit about trading

a website that replies to you whether something is objectively real or a construct and quotes reference str support it

a website that reads the IP origin and provides quotes from a culture that is located on the opposing side of the earth

<br>basic html elements:

tags,
opening tag, closing tag and some content, attributes
alt= is an attribute.

all the things inside an opening tag <a for example are attributes

<h1>hello</h1>

<br>headers:
there are 6
it's h with a number inside the <> up to 6

body is a visible content of the page

everything that the user sees goes in between the closing body tag

ul>li* + tab creates n unordered list with 4 elements using shorthand code in pycharm


<br>CSS - is being approached more like a programming language. You can just use bootstrap if you don't want to use css


<br>lang attribute is an attribute to the language tag tells the computer how to interpret the arguments

you can just create a new StyleSheet in python

CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets - executes from top to bottom, so if lower exectures over an upper then it overrides

it's cascading but you can write a css in a style head




<br>if you are working with a different language you can address specific class elements.
The advantage of using HTML classes on your elements? unify elements :
<br>unify elements,
<br>easier to maintain
<br>style the elements

<p class="main-content">?Hello!</p>

<br>classes are your way to refer to elements. In boostrap they have their own names but you can overwrite them
if you really need to.

<br>main = red
content = blue
cascading, the last one holds the truth so thw content would prevail
    you apply boostrap styles to your elements by giving it multiple classes by separating the in
    with spaces in the class parenthesis
            <br>bootstrap is designed for mobil-first. it's responsive by default on your phone, it's also very easy
    if you wanna focus on backend development but you want to have something to show for it.
    Bootstrap is a CSS HTML framework
<br>link is for linking stylesheets
<br>href is an attribute that has a certain value like URL attribute with value (URL), those are the pieces of an html element
<br>link does not have a closing tag like some html elements.
<br>meta does not have one
<br>img does not have a closing tag
<br>the order of attributes does not matter, much like in a dictionary.


<br>P within CSS is called a selector, put a space, or not. Color below is a property, red is a value.
Split syntax is nice cause you can throw many properties in there. you're not making an HTML file from your stylesheet
it's the other way around, you link an html element to a CSS file.

P {
    colour: red;


    }

.highlight{
        color: red;
    }
<br>how do you make all child <p> elements of the class:
    you make an angular bracket that point to > { and then you define it


<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">



<section class="content"></section>

steps that are necessary to use bootstrap in your HTML:
<br>1. link to bootstrap / online CDN.
<br>2. <div.class="container"> end tag
